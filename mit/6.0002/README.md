# MIT OpenCourseWare: 6.0002 Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science

[Source](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016)

## Goals

* Provide an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems.
* Help students, including those who do not necessarily plan to major in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, feel confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals.
* Position students so that they can compete for research projects and excel in subjects with programming components.
