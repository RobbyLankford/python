# Problem 6 Write-up

## Question 1

What happens to the total population before introducing the antibiotic?

Before introducing the antibiotic, the total population was always more than the resistant population. The growth rate varies, as in Simulation A it grows very quickly, but in simulation B it only grows for a few time steps then starts rapidly decreasing.

## Question 2

What happens to the resistant population before introducing the antibiotic?

Before introducing the antibiotic, the resistant population is always less than the total population. The growth rate varies, as in Simulation A it grows quickly for a few time steps, then decreases to a steady state, but in Simulation B it grows quickly, decreases slightly for a while, then decreases to nothing.

## Question 3

What happens to the total population after introducing the antibiotic?

After introducing the antibiotic, the total population decreases rapidly and dramatically until becoming equal with the resistant population.

## Question 4

What happens to the resistant population after introducing the antibiotic?

After introducting the antibiotic, the resistant population becomes equal to the total population, as the total population decreases rapidly.

## Confidence Intervals

Simulation A (95% CI at time step 299):
Total - (197.84, 8.83)
Resistant - (197.84, 8.83)

Simulation B (95% CI at time step 299):
Total - (0.0, 0.0)
Resistant - (0.0, 0.0)
